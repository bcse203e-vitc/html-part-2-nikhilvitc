                <p>A fire accident occurred late one evening in a small apartment building. A tenant, cooking dinner, accidentally left a pan on the stove unattended while answering a phone call. The oil in the pan overheated, igniting a small flame. Panic set in as the fire spread quickly to nearby kitchen items, and smoke filled the air. The tenant, realizing the danger, tried to douse the flames with water, but this only made it worse. Fortunately, a neighbor heard the alarm and called the fire department..</p>
